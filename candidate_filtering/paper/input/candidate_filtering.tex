\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:section}

  Since the last decade, the amount of information available on the web is
  constantly increasing. While the number of documents continues to grow, the
  need for efficient information retrieval methods becomes increasingly
  important. One way to improve retrieval effectiveness is to use
  keyphrases~\cite{jones1999phrasier}. Keyphrases are single or multi-word
  expressions that represent the main content of a document. As they describe
  the key topics in documents, keyphrases are also useful for tasks such as
  summarization~\cite{avanzo2005keyphrase} or document
  indexing~\cite{medelyan2008smalltrainingset}. There is, however, only a small
  number of documents that have keyphrases associated with them. Keyphrase
  extraction has then attracted a lot of attention recently and many different
  approaches were proposed~\cite{hasan2014state_of_the_art}.

  Generally speaking, keyphrase extraction methods can be categorized into two
  main categories: supervised and unsupervised approaches. Supervised approaches
  treat keyphrase extraction as a binary classification task, where each phrase
  is labeled either as ``keyphrase'' or ``non-keyphrase'',
  e.g.~\cite{witten1999kea}. Conversely, unsupervised approaches usually rank
  phrases by importance and select the top-ranked ones as keyphrases,
  e.g.~\cite{mihalcea2004textrank}. Although they tackle the keyphrase
  extraction problem differently, both supervised and unsupervised methods rely
  on a candidate selection step. Candidate selection consists in identifying the
  textual units of a document that have properties similar to those of
  human-assigned keyphrases. Selecting appropriate keyphrase candidates is
  particularly important since it determines the upper bound performance of the
  keyphrase extraction methods~\cite{wang2014keyphraseextractionpreprocessing}.

  In previous work, candidate selection is performed either by selecting
  n-grams, noun phrase chunks (NP-chunks) or word sequences matching given
  Part-of-Speech (POS) patterns~\cite{hulth2003keywordextraction}. In this
  study, we first analyze the properties of human-assigned keyphrases and
  discuss how candidates selected by different candidate selection methods
  satisfy these properties. We then propose a new approach that filters out
  irrelevant adjective modifiers from sequences of nouns, proper nouns and
  adjectives. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by looking at the
  completeness of the sets of selected candidates and by comparing the
  performance of state-of-the-art supervised and unsupervised keyphrase
  extraction methods on three standard datasets of different language and
  nature.

  The rest of this paper is organized as follows.
  Section~\ref{sec:definition_of_candidate_keyphrases} introduces an analysis of
  the properties of human-assigned keyphrases.
  Section~\ref{sec:candidate_extraction} presents the commonly used candidate
  selection methods and describes our new approach. Experiments are discussed in
  Section~\ref{sec:evaluation} and Section~\ref{sec:conclusion} concludes this
  paper.

\section{What is a Keyphrase?}
\label{sec:definition_of_candidate_keyphrases}
  In this section, we infer two keyphrase properties from the analysis of
  human-assigned keyphrases of three standard datasets.

  \subsection{Datasets}
  \label{subsec:keyphrase_extraction_datasets}
    \paragraph{DUC~\textnormal{\cite{over2001duc}}} is a collection of 308
    English news articles covering about 30 topics (e.g.~tornadoes, gun control,
    etc.). This collection is the test dataset of the DUC-2001 summarization
    evaluation campaign and contains reference keyphrases annotated by
    \newcite{wan2008expandrank}. We split the collection into two sets: a
    training set containing 208 documents and a test set containing 100
    documents.

    \paragraph{SemEval~\textnormal{\cite{kim2010semeval}}} contains 244 English
    scientific papers collected from the ACM Digital Libraries (conference and
    workshop papers). The papers are divided into two sets: a training set
    containing 144 documents and a test set containing 100 documents. The
    associated keyphrases are provided by both authors and readers.

    \paragraph{DEFT~\textnormal{\cite{paroubek2012deft}}} is a collection of 234
    French scientific papers that belong to the \textit{Humanities and Social
    Sciences} domain. DEFT is divided into two sets: a training set containing
    141 documents and a test set containing 93 documents. Keyphrases provided
    with the documents of DEFT are given by authors.

  \subsection{Analysis of Reference Keyphrases}
  \label{subsec:keyphrase_analysis}
    Table~\ref{tab:train_dataset_statistics} shows statistics about the training
    sets and the keyphrases associated to their documents. First, keyphrases are
    presented regarding their number of words. Second, the multi-word keyphrases
    are presented regarding the Part-of-Speech of their words\footnote{We
    observed that keyphrases containing one word are mostly nouns or proper
    nouns. Hence, we only show the POS tag statistics of the multi-word
    keyphrases.}. To obtain these Part-of-Speech, we automatically POS tagged
    the keyphrases of the English datasets with the Stanford POS
    tagger~\cite{toutanova2003stanfordpostagger} and the keyphrases of the
    French dataset with MElt~\cite{denis2009melt}. To avoid tagging errors, POS
    tagged keyphrases were manually corrected. As for relational adjectives,
    these are automatically detected, among labeled adjectives, using external
    resources and well-known suffixes of relational adjectives (as discussed in
    Section~\ref{subsubsec:method_settings}).
    
    From the observation of the statistics in
    Table~\ref{tab:train_dataset_statistics}, we propose two properties:

               adjective}, respectively.
               \label{tab:best_patterns}}
    \end{table*}

    First, we observe, as stated in previous work, that most keyphrases are
    unigrams or bigrams ($\simeq$~80\%).
    
    \begin{property}\label{prop:informativity}
      Keyphrases are small-sized textual units; Keyphrases usually contain one
      up to three words (e.g.~``storms'', ``hurricane expert'' or ``annual
      hurricane forecast'').
    \end{property}

    Second, we observe that almost every keyphrase contains a noun and half of
    them are modified by an adjective. Most importantly, among these adjectives,
    there is an important amount of relational adjectives. Relational adjectives
    are derived from a noun (e.g. ``cultural'' is derived from ``culture'') and
    represent a relation to it (e.g. in ``cultural heritage'', the ``heritage''
    is related to a ``culture''). As a consequence, relational
    adjectives are relevant for taxonomic classes (e.g. Wikipedia articles
    \textit{building restoration}, \textit{national treasure} and \textit{food
    heritage} are all grouped under the \textit{cultural heritage} category)
    and, therefore, they are more relevant keyphrase modifiers than other
    adjectives (attributive adjectives).

    \begin{property}\label{prop:noun_phrases}
      Keyphrases are mostly nouns (e.g.~``storms'') that can be modified by an
      adjective (e.g.~``annual hurricane forecast''), which is most likely a
      relational adjective.
    \end{property}

    To give more insight about the nature of keyphrases,
    Table~\ref{tab:best_patterns} shows the five most frequent POS tag sequences
    for English and French.

\section{Candidate Selection}
\label{sec:candidate_extraction}
  In this section, we present the textual units that are commonly used as
  keyphrase candidates and discuss their consistency regarding the properties
  inferred in Section~\ref{sec:definition_of_candidate_keyphrases}. We also
  propose a new approach that filters out adjectives that do not significantly
  contribute to the meaning of a noun phrase.

  \paragraph{N-grams} are ordered sequences of $n$ adjacent words, where $n$ is
  usually set to 1 up to 3~\cite{witten1999kea}. Extracting n-grams has the
  benefit to provide almost every candidates that actually match reference
  keyphrases (maximum recall), but the counterpart is that it also provides a
  huge amount of irrelevant candidates. Although \newcite{witten1999kea}
  propose to select only n-grams that do not contain a stop word (conjunction,
  preposition, determiner or common word) at their beginning or end, filtered
  n-grams are grammatically uncontrolled and do not fit
  properties~\ref{prop:informativity} and~\ref{prop:noun_phrases}.

  \paragraph{Textual units matching given POS tag patterns} are textual units of
  specific syntactic forms. Selecting such textual units ensures grammaticality
  and precisely defines the nature of the candidates. In previous work,
  \newcite{hulth2003keywordextraction} experiments with the most frequent POS
  tag patterns of her training data\footnote{Frequent patterns are the ones that
  appear at least ten times in the training data.}, whereas other researchers
  select the longest sequences of nouns, proper nouns and adjectives, namely
  the longest NPs~\cite{hassan2010conundrums}. Candidates selected using both
  approaches fit properties~\ref{prop:informativity}
  and~\ref{prop:noun_phrases}. However, the first approach requires training
  data and is, therefore, not suitable for every situation.

  \paragraph{NP-chunks} are non-recursive noun phrases. As NP-chunks are minimal
  noun phrases, they fit both properties~\ref{prop:informativity}
  and~\ref{prop:noun_phrases}. Also, they have been shown to induce high
  performance on supervised keyphrase
  extraction~\cite{hulth2003keywordextraction}.

  \paragraph{}
  \hspace{-1em}As a contribution to the candidate selection step, we propose to
  select refined noun phrases (\textbf{refined NPs}) by adding a decision
  process during the selection of noun, proper noun and adjective sequences (cf.
  Algorithm~\ref{algo:adjective_filtering}). Indeed, we assume that adjectives
  are sometimes implicit or add extra information (e.g.~``wildfires'' is
  preferable to ``huge wildfires''). Hence, they must be kept only under
  specific conditions. First, regarding property~\ref{prop:informativity} we
  estimate that only one adjective should be part of a keyphrase candidate.
  Second, we assume that a frequent modification of a noun phrase by the same
  adjective (at least twice) is a clue of its usefulness. Third, according to
  property~\ref{prop:noun_phrases} and the usefulness of relational adjectives
  for other tasks such as topic detection and term
  extraction~\cite{daille2001relationaladjectives}, we consider relational
  adjectives as a specific class of adjectives and assume that they are always
  useful, i.e. they always contribute to the meaning of a keyphrase candidate.

      }
    }

             \label{algo:adjective_filtering}}
  \end{algorithm}

\section{Keyphrase Extraction}
\label{sec:keyphrase_extraction}
  Once candidates are selected, the second step of the keyphrase extraction task
  is to rank or classify them. In this section, we detail the three keyphrase
  extraction methods that we use in our study. Two are unsupervised (ranking
  methods) and one is supervised (classification method).

  \paragraph{TF-IDF~\textnormal{\cite{jones1972tfidf}}} is a weighting scheme
  that represents the significance of a word in a given document. Significant
  words must be both frequent in the document and specific to it, where word
  specificity is determined based on a collection of documents: the lower is the
  amount of documents containing a given word, the higher is its specificity.
  Keyphrase candidates are scored according to the normalized sum of the TF-IDF
  weights of their words and the $k$ best candidates are extracted as
  keyphrases.

  \paragraph{TopicRank~\textnormal{\cite{bougouin2013topicrank}}} aims to
  extract keyphrases that best represent the main topics of a document.
  Keyphrase candidates are clustered into topics using a Hierarchical
  Agglomerative Clustering (HAC) and a stem overlap similarity (with a threshold
  set to 0.25), each topic is scored using the TextRank random walk
  algorithm~\cite{mihalcea2004textrank} and one representative keyphrase (the
  first appearing candidate) is extracted from each of the $k$ best ranked
  topics.

  \paragraph{KEA~\textnormal{\cite{witten1999kea}}} is a supervised method that
  uses a Naive Bayes classifier to extract keyphrases. The classifier combines
  two feature probabilities to predict whether a candidate is a ``keyphrase'' or
  a ``non-keyphrase''. The two features are the TF-IDF weight\footnote{Unlike
  the TF-IDF weight we present, the TF-IDF weight computed for KEA is based on
  candidate frequency (n-gram-based TF-IDF), not word frequency.} of the
  candidate and the position of its first appearance in the document.

\section{Experiments}
\label{sec:evaluation}
  To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we perform two series of
  experiments. First, we compare the quality of the selected candidates with the
  set of reference keyphrases. Second, we compare their impact on the keyphrase
  extraction task, applying them to TF-IDF, TopicRank and KEA.

      \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Candidate selection statistics.
             \label{tab:candidate_extraction_statistics}}
  \end{table*}

  \subsection{Evaluation Measures}
  \label{subsec:keyphrase_extraction_evaluation_measures}
    To quantify the capacity of the keyphrase candidate selection methods to
    provide suitable candidates and avoid irrelevant ones, we compute the
    number of selected candidates (Cand./Doc.) and confront it with the
    maximum recall (R$_{max}$) that can be achieved. To do so, we compute a
    quality ratio (QR):
    \begin{align}
      \text{QR} &= \frac{\text{R$_{max}$}}{\text{Cand./Doc.}} \times 100
    \end{align}
    The higher is the QR value of a candidate set, the better is its quality.

    To evaluate the performance of the keyphrase extraction methods, we use
    the common measures of precision (P), recall (R) and f-score (F), when a
    maximum of 10 keyphrases are extracted.

  \subsection{Preprocessing}
  \label{subsec:preprocessing}
    For each dataset, we apply the following preprocessing steps: sentence
    segmentation, word tokenization and Part-of-Speech tagging. For sentence
    segmentation, we use the PunktSentenceTokenizer provided by the Python
    Natural Language ToolKit~\cite[NLTK]{bird2009nltk}. For word tokenization,
    we use the NLTK TreebankWordTokenizer for English and the Bonsai word
    tokenizer\footnote{The Bonsai word tokenizer is a tool provided with the
    Bonsai PCFG-LA parser:
    \url{http://alpage.inria.fr/statgram/frdep/fr_stat_dep_parsing.html}.} for
    French. As for Part-of-Speech tagging, we use the Stanford
    POS tagger~\cite{toutanova2003stanfordpostagger} for English and
    MElt~\cite{denis2009melt} for French.

  \subsection{Candidate Selection}
  \label{subsec:candidate_extraction}

    This section presents an intrinsic evaluation of the candidate selection
    methods described in Section~\ref{sec:candidate_extraction}. The aim is to
    compare the methods in terms of quantity of selected candidates and
    percentage of reference keyphrases that can be found in the best case
    (maximum recall).

    \subsubsection{Method Settings}
    \label{subsubsec:method_settings}
      For each candidate selection method presented in
      section~\ref{sec:candidate_extraction}, we set the parameters in order to
      best fit  properties~\ref{prop:informativity}
      and~\ref{prop:noun_phrases}.

      \paragraph{}
      According to Property~\ref{prop:informativity}, we use a filtered n-gram
      selection method that provides small-sized n-grams: $n = \{1..3\}$
      (\textbf{\{1..3\}-grams}). The stop words used for the filtering are part
      of the IR Multilingual
      Resources\footnote{\url{http://members.unine.ch/jacques.savoy/clef/index.html}}
      provided by the University of Neuchâtel (UniNE).

      \paragraph{}
      Following both Property~\ref{prop:noun_phrases} and previous
      work~\cite{hassan2010conundrums}, we use pattern matching to select the
      longest noun phrases (\textbf{longest NPs}), i.e.~the longest sequences of
      nouns, proper nouns and adjectives:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item{\texttt{(Nc | Np | A)+}, for both English and French.}
      \end{itemize}

      \paragraph{}
      The \textbf{NP-chunk} selection is also performed using pattern matching.
      Only basic patterns are used:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item{\texttt{Np+ |~(A+~Nc) |~Nc+}, for English;}
        \item{\texttt{Np+ |~(A?~Nc~A+) |~(A~Nc) |~Nc+}, for French.}
      \end{itemize}

      \paragraph{}
      The \textbf{refined NPs} are also selected using pattern matching.
      However, unlike the longest NPs and the NP-chunks, the refined NPs are
      selected using patterns defined in regard of the relational adjective
      position in the target language:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item{\texttt{A? (Nc~|~Np)+}, for English;}
        \item{\texttt{(Nc~|~Np)+ A?}, for French\footnote{This pattern filters
              out every attributive adjective that modifies nouns from the
              left.}.}
      \end{itemize}
      To detect relational adjectives, we use a list of known relational
      adjective suffixes combined to a lexical database. In English, adjectives
      are considered relational if their suffix matches ``al'', ``ant'',
      ``ary'', ``ic'', ``ous'' or
      ``ive''~\cite{grabar2006terminologystructuring}, or if they have a
      pertainym in the WordNet database~\cite{miller1995wordnet}. In French,
      adjectives are considered relational if their suffix matches ``ain'',
      ``aire'', ``al'', ``el'', ``eux'', ``ien'', ``ier'', ``ique'' or
      ``ois''~\cite{harastani2013relationaladjectivetranslation}, or if they are
      related to a noun in the WoNeF database~\cite{pradet2013wonef}.

      Also, to show the effectiveness of our adjective filtering, we use a
      baseline, which extracts keyphrase candidates with the same patterns, but
      does not filter out the adjectives (\textbf{Refined NPs BL}).

    \subsubsection{Result Analysis}
    \label{subsubsec:candidate_extraction_result_analysis}
      Table~\ref{tab:candidate_extraction_statistics} shows the statistics of
      the candidate selection methods. First, we observe that selecting
      $\{1..3\}$-grams as candidates allows the best possible performance
      (maximum recall). However, the other methods do not perform a
      significantly lower maximum recall while their number of selected
      candidates is significantly decreased (about four times lesser). This is
      very beneficial, because high complexity algorithms, such as TopicRank's
      $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering (HAC), will
      respond faster with the methods selecting longest NPs, NP-chunks or
      refined NPS, without performance loss for the keyphrase extraction.
      Second, according to the the quality ratio, selecting refined NPs is the
      best strategy to allow a good maximum recall while avoiding as much
      irrelevant keyphrase candidates as possible. Moreover, although the
      pattern we propose for the refined NPs is more restricted than the one of
      the longest NPs and the NP-chunks, the maximum recall is almost the same.
      From the pattern definition to the adjective filtering strategy,
      Table~\ref{tab:candidate_extraction_statistics} confirms the validity of
      our approach.

      Finally, refined NPs BL and refined NPs statistics on DEFT are
      interesting. Indeed, selecting refined NPs allows the exact same maximum
      recall than selecting refined NPs BL while the number of candidates is
      decreased. This proves that keeping, from a candidate, relational
      adjectives and attributive adjectives that modify at least twice its noun
      phrase is a good strategy. However, no new candidates matching reference
      keyphrases are selected, only irrelevant keyphrase candidates are removed.

  \subsection{Keyphrase Extraction}
  \label{subsec:keyphrase_extraction}
    This section presents an extrinsic evaluation of the candidate selection
    methods. The aim is to observe the impact of the candidate selection
    methods on the keyphrase extraction task.

    \subsubsection{Result Analysis}
    \label{subsubsec:candidate_extraction_result_analysis}
      Tables~\ref{tab:tfidf_results},~\ref{tab:topicrank_results}~and~\ref{tab:kea_results}
      show the performance of respectively TF-IDF, TopicRank and KEA when they
      extract 10 keyphrases from keyphrase candidates provided by each candidate
      selection method. Overall, results of the keyphrase extraction are very
      low. These low results, which are in the range of the results obtained in
      previous
      work~\cite{hassan2010conundrums,kim2010semeval,paroubek2012deft}\footnote{In
      the case of SemEval and DEFT evaluation
      campaigns~\cite{kim2010semeval,paroubek2012deft}, many methods may have
      better results than ours, but what we present here are pure methods,
      i.e.~no parameter tuning has been done to obtain higher results on each
      dataset. Also, the TF-IDF ranking method we use here is not comparable
      with the one of~\newcite{kim2010semeval}, which works better on long
      documents than short documents.}, tend to prove that focussing on highest
      maximum recall is less important than focussing on the quality of the
      selected keyphrase candidates.

            %\textbf{Abstract}

            \setlength\parindent{12pt}
            Intelligent agents that are intended to work in dynamic
            environments must be able to gracefully handle unsuccessful tasks
            and plans. In addition, such agents should be able to make rational
            decisions about an appropriate course of action, which may include
            aborting a task or plan, either as a result of the agent"s own
            deliberations, or potentially at the request of another agent. In
            this paper we investigate the incorporation of aborts into a
            BDI-style  architecture. We discuss some conditions under which
            aborting a task or plan is appropriate, and how to determine the
            consequences of such a decision. We augment each plan with an
            optional abort-method, analogous to the failure method found in some
            agent programming languages. We provide an operational semantics for
            the execution cycle in the presence of aborts in the abstract agent
            language CAN, which enables us to specify a BDI-based execution
            model without limiting our attention to a particular agent system
            (such as JACK, Jadex, Jason, or SPARK). A key technical challenge we
            address is the presence of parallel execution threads and of
            sub-tasks, which require the agent to ensure that the abort methods
            for each plan are carried out in an appropriate sequence. [\dots]

      On the first hand, we observe that KEA's performance is scarcely affected
      by the irrelevant candidates included in lower quality candidates such as
      n-grams, whereas TF-IDF and TopicRank show more difficulty to extract
      correct keyphrases from them. Hence, proposing an unsupervised keyphrase
      extraction method must be accompanied by a study of the most suitable
      keyphrase candidates.

      On the second hand, we observe that selecting refined NPs outperforms
      other candidate selection methods in most cases. As shown by the example
      in Figure~\ref{fig:example}, removing irrelevant adjectives (e.g removing
      ``unsuccessful'' from ``unsuccessful task'') can help to better extract
      keyphrases (cf. TopicRank's keyphrases). However, we observe that
      our adjective filtering strategy does not work well on DUC. The documents
      contained in the DUC dataset are smaller than the documents contained in
      SemEval and DEFT, so filtering out attributive adjectives from noun
      phrases occurring only once is less effective. Also, TopicRank applied to
      DEFT with the refined NPs does not perform better than TopicRank with the
      longest NPs. In this particular case, the clustering order in the topic
      clustering changes, which leads to different topics that somehow decrease
      the ranking effectiveness. Finally, KEA's better performance when using
      refined NPs demonstrate that our approach selects candidates that are
      easier to discriminate based on simple features such as TF-IDF and first
      position in the document.

\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:related_work}
  Previous work on keyphrase extraction mainly focused on keyphrase candidate
  ranking and classification~\cite{hasan2014state_of_the_art} while previous
  work trying to determine the impact of different keyphrase candidates on
  keyphrase extraction methods did not get to much attention.

  \newcite{hulth2003keywordextraction} is one of the first researchers that
  proposed a comparative study of candidate selection methods. She described
  three methods selecting either n-grams, textual units maching given patterns
  or NP-chunks, applied them on a supervised keyphrase extraction method and
  observed how linguistic knowledge can improve the classification of the
  keyphrase candidates. As, she showed, tackling the keyphrase candidate
  selection using linguistic knowledge, as we done considering the adjectives'
  category, induces improvement of keyphrase extraction methods.

  Previous work of \newcite{zesch2009rprecision} also pointed out one
  interesting fact about keyphrase candidate selection. Indeed, although their
  work focused on a new evaluation measure for automatic keyphrase extraction,
  they provided experiments using various types of keyphrase candidates and
  pointed out the ``overgeneration'' problem of some candidate selection
  methods.

  More recently, \newcite{wang2014keyphraseextractionpreprocessing} proposed a
  comparative study of commonly used candidate selection methods. As we do in
  this paper, they proposed an empirical comparison of them and compared how
  well they cover reference keyphrases. However, they did not supplement this
  with an analysis of human-assigned keyphrases and a discussion of those
  methods reguarding the properties of human-assigned keyphrases.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
  In this paper, we stated that the candidate selection is a critical step of
  the keyphrase extraction task. Based on a study of human-assigned keyphrases,
  we inferred two keyphrase properties (1.~small-sized 2.~noun phrases mostly
  modified by relational adjectives) and
  discussed how commonly used candidate selection methods satisfy them. To best
  fit those properties, we also proposed a new method that filters out
  attributive adjectives when they are judged to have a useless contribution to
  the meaning of their keyphrase candidate.

  To validate our method, we carried out two experiments on three standard
  datasets. We observed that our method reduces the number of selected
  candidates without significantly decreasing the best possible recall and that,
  in most cases, it induces the best results of different keyphrase extraction
  methods. Hence, we demonstrated that simple linguistic filtering of adjectives
  can increase the quality of the selected candidates and positively influence
  the keyphrase extraction.
